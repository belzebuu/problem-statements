## Introduction

In this section provide a brief introduction of the problem, possibly including
its motivation and context. This should be a short (2 or 3 paragraphs)
high-level description.


In the winter season, when forecasts announce temperatures below the freezing point, municipalities are faced with the task of spreading salt in their road networks. 
The case discussed here has been presented by the company Aiban that has been
contracted by local authorities of the Danish municipalities of Kerteminde and Middelfart. 




## Task


Describe the high-level optimisation task in one or two sentences.

Given a road network made of roads that need to be salted, roads that can be transited and directions of transit, given a fleet of salt vehicles with a salt capacity, 
We want to find the set of routes that satisfy specific requirements and minimizes to the total travelled distance. Minimizing the travelled distance is correlated with achiving the task in the fastest way and with the minimal environmental impact (CO2 imprint). 
In order to be usable in practice the routes must take into account that to when spreading salt there must be residual  capacity in the vehicle. Hence, the visit to salt depots to refill the load must be considered. Further, U-turns in some parts of the networks are not allowed.



## Detailed description

Provide a detailed description of the problem in this section. This should
detail what parameters characterise a problem instance, what characterises a
solution, how a solution is evaluated (e.g. an objective function), and solution
feasibility constraints.


A number of
vehicles depart from their respective dwelling place nodes and have to salt given
set of roads. The load of salt that the vehicles can carry is in general
insufficient to cover all roads, therefore routes might include reloading
at opportune depots. After having salted the requested roads, the
vehicles visit a depot where they are reloaded with fuell and salt
before heading dwelling place, ready for the next day. There is a maximum time of
3 hours and a half for completing the task. It is assumed that the
vehicles are "off duty" after the final reload, hence the path from the
depot to dwelling place does not count in the duration and in the cost
calculation. Further, due to the size of the vehicles, U-turns at some
intersections are not allowed. 

<!--
The problem is a generalization of the Capacited Arcs Routing
Problem~\cite{Arc9} with the additional constraints of reloading and
U-turn avoidance.
-->

In the following we specify the problem more formally.


We denote by $Z$, indexed by $z$, the set of vehicles, by $K$, indexed by $k$, 
the set of all trips and by $K^z \subseteq K$ the set of trips composing the route of the
vehicle $z \in Z$. 

We represent the road network by a *mixed graph* $\hat{G}=(V, E \cup \hat{A})$. The set of nodes $V$ includes the set of road
intersections, the set of refilling depots $D$ and the set of dwelling places to the vehicles
$H$. Each vehicle has a single location $h$ from $H$ from which it
departs and returns.  The
set $E$ is the set of edges that can be traversed in both directions and
it includes the set $E_R$ of edges that are required to be salted.
The set of arcs $A$ represents links that can be traversed only in one direction 
and it includes the set $A_R$ of arcs required to be salted.



<!--
The mixed graph $\hat{G}$ can be transformed in a directed graph $G=(V,A)$ by substituting
every edge $(i,j) \in E$ by two antiparallel arcs $(i,j)$ and $(j,i)$
and keeping the required arcs, thus getting the sets ${A} =
A\cup\{(i,j),(j,i) : (i,j) \in E\}$ and $R = A_R\cup\{(i,j),(j,i): (i,j)
\in E_R\} \subseteq \hat{A}$.


Given a subset $S\subseteq V$, the cut set $\delta(S)$ denotes the set
of edges with exatly one endpoint in $S$; $\delta^+(S)$ is the set of
outgoing arcs and $\delta^-(S)$ the set of ingoing arcs.

Let $x^k_{ij}$ be a binary variable that indicates whether the link
$(i,j) \in E_R \cup A_R$ is served and let $y^k_{ij}\in \mathbb{Z}^+_0$ be
an integer variable representing the number of times a link $(i,j) \in
A$ is deadheaded.  Let $\alpha_{vk}$ and $\beta_{vk}$ for $v\in
D\cup H$ and $k\in K$ be auxiliary
binary variables that indicate whether a node is visited.
-->


We call a *trip* the sequence of arcs and edges visited by a vehicle
that departs from a dwelling place or from a depot and arrives at a dwelling place or at a
depot. A *route* is a sequence of trips that depart from a dwelling place and
arrives at a dwelling place.


The task is finding a set of routes of minimal total length such that: 
- the required edges and required arcs are visited by at least one vehicle's route.
- the difference between the departure and the arrival time of each route is not greater than a given time limit $T$.
- At any point in the route the residual capacity is non-negative. 



## Instance data file

Describe the format of a problem instance file.


The Data are provided by the company Aiban. It is in the form of a
spread sheet as seen in Figure~\ref{data}.

\end{figure}



Each node ("Knude punkt") represents a road intersection and at each
node it is given a set of edges (roads) departing from that node. The
column ``status'' indicates whether an edge needs to be salted and in
which direction. A status of 1 indicates that the edges need to be
salted but the direction is free. A status of 2 indicates that the edge
must be salted in a predefined direction. A status of 3 indicates that
the edge does not need to be salted. We assume that all edges listed can
be traversed in both directions. {\mc{I need to ask to the company if
    this is true.}

Each edge has a column indicating the length of the road ("l{\ae}ngde")
and a column indicating the breadth of the road ("salt m"), both
represented in meters. The vehicles are identical. They have a salt
capacity of $12.3 \mathrm{m}^3$ and they spread $30\textrm{ml}$ of salt
per $\mathrm{m}^2$ of road. Since, $1\textrm{ml} = 1
\mathrm{cm}^3=10^{-6}\mathrm{m^3}$, on each road segment of length $\ell$
and width $w$ (expressed in $\mathrm{m}$ they use $30\cdot 10^{-6} \cdot
\ell \cdot w\mathrm{m}^3$ of salt. The depots are in node 1 and in node 179
and the two drivers start and end at their dwelling places at node 2 and 130,
respectively. The salting of the roads has to be completed within 3.5
hours and the overall objective is to minimise the total travelled
distance. The drivers visit a depot before returning dwelling place with their
vehicles, therefore they start with a full cargo hold of salt and fuel
tanks. The path from the depot to dwelling place does not count in the traveling
time and distance.
